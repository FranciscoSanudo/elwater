# Project Name

Water Treatment Dosification with Lisp

## Description

This project focuses on a specific aspect of water treatment: dosification of chemicals using Lisp programming. It aims to provide a practical example of how Lisp can be used to automate and optimize the dosing process in water treatment plants. By leveraging the power of Lisp, we can bridge the gap between the noble field of water science and the world of automation and programming.
